### What I learned

I tried in this challenge for the first time BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)
and I'm willing to improve in using this method in the future.

- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) - This helped me for BEM methods . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
